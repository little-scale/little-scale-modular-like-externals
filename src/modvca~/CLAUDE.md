# modvca~ Development Notes

This file documents the development process, architecture decisions, and technical insights from creating the `modvca~` Make Noise MODDEMIX-style VCA external for Max/MSP.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create an authentic emulation of the unique VCA section from the Make Noise MODDEMIX module, featuring amplitude-dependent distortion where low levels exhibit more harmonic content and high levels remain clean.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Production ready, universal binary with smooth amplitude-dependent saturation

**Key Achievement**: Successful implementation of linear amplitude-dependent saturation that creates musical "tail character" where signals develop pleasing harmonic coloration as they decay, with smooth transition throughout the entire amplitude range.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation and Concept
- **Goal**: Implement basic MODDEMIX VCA concept with amplitude-dependent distortion
- **Initial Approach**: Exponential VCA curve with multi-stage tanh saturation
- **Challenge**: Complex multi-stage processing created unpredictable behavior
- **Result**: Working prototype but with non-linear saturation characteristics

### Phase 2: Unity Gain and Passthrough Issues
- **Problem**: CV=1.0 with unity input not producing unity output
- **Root Causes**: 
  - `OUTPUT_COMPENSATION = 0.7` reducing all output to 70%
  - Distortion applied even at high amplitudes
  - Hard amplitude cutoff creating discontinuities
- **Solution**: Fixed compensation factor and added high-amplitude bypass
- **Result**: Proper unity gain at full CV levels

### Phase 3: Smooth Saturation Transition (Inverse Scaling Method)
- **Goal**: Eliminate hard cutoffs and create smooth saturation transition
- **Approach**: Inverse amplitude scaling → tanh → scale back down method
- **Implementation**: `scaled_input = input * (1/amplitude)` → `tanh()` → `* amplitude`
- **Challenge**: Still created two-portion tail behavior due to tanh nonlinearity
- **Result**: Improved but not yet optimal saturation behavior

### Phase 4: Linear VCA Response
- **Problem**: Exponential VCA curve (`amplitude = level^4.0`) causing unpredictable transitions
- **Solution**: Changed to linear VCA response (`amplitude = level`)
- **Benefits**: Direct 1:1 CV-to-amplitude relationship, more predictable behavior
- **Result**: Simplified amplitude calculation with better user control

### Phase 5: Linear Drive Interpolation (Final Solution)
- **Problem**: Two-portion tail behavior persisted with inverse scaling approach
- **Root Cause**: Tanh saturation curve has different slopes at different input levels
- **Solution**: Linear drive interpolation: `drive = max_drive * (1 - amplitude) + min_drive`
- **Implementation**: Simple linear relationship between amplitude and saturation drive
- **Result**: Smooth, single-phase saturation transition throughout entire amplitude range

## Technical Architecture

### Core Algorithm: Linear Drive Interpolation

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```c
// Linear drive calculation
double drive = MAX_SATURATION_DRIVE * (1.0 - amplitude) + MIN_SATURATION_DRIVE;

// Where:
// MAX_SATURATION_DRIVE = 8.0  (heavy saturation at low amplitude)
// MIN_SATURATION_DRIVE = 0.1  (clean signal at high amplitude)
```

**Amplitude-to-Drive Mapping**:
- **Amplitude = 1.0** → Drive = 0.1 (minimal saturation, clean signal)
- **Amplitude = 0.5** → Drive = 4.05 (moderate saturation)
- **Amplitude = 0.1** → Drive = 7.3 (heavy saturation, rich harmonics)
- **Amplitude = 0.0** → Drive = 8.0 (maximum saturation)

**Saturation Process**:
```c
// Apply saturation with calculated drive amount
double driven_signal = input * drive;
double saturated = tanh(driven_signal);

// Compensate for drive to maintain consistent output level
double output = saturated / drive;
```

### Linear VCA Response

**Simplified Amplitude Calculation**:
```c
// Direct linear mapping (no exponential curve)
double amplitude = level;  // CV 0.5 = 50% amplitude, CV 1.0 = 100% amplitude
```

**Benefits of Linear Response**:
- Predictable control: CV value directly corresponds to amplitude percentage
- No curve interactions that could cause discontinuities
- Intuitive user experience: 50% CV = 50% volume
- Smooth saturation progression throughout range

### Data Structure Design

**Optimized for Real-Time Processing**:
```c
typedef struct _moddemix_vca {
    t_pxobject ob;              // MSP object header
    
    // Parameter storage (lores~ pattern)
    double level_float;         // CV/level when no signal connected
    short level_has_signal;     // 1 if level inlet has signal connection
    
    // VCA state
    double envelope_follower;   // Smoothed amplitude measurement (for future use)
    double previous_output;     // For DC blocking (for future use)
    
    // Sample rate
    double sr;                  // Sample rate
    double sr_inv;              // 1.0 / sample rate
} t_moddemix_vca;
```

## Algorithm Evolution and Lessons Learned

### Initial Multi-Stage Approach (Discarded)
```c
// Complex multi-stage processing (caused unpredictable behavior)
output = harmonic_saturation(output, distortion_amount, 1);      // Odd harmonics
output = harmonic_saturation(output, distortion_amount * 0.6, 2); // Even harmonics  
output = harmonic_saturation(output, distortion_amount * 0.3, 3); // Higher-order
```

**Problems**:
- Multiple saturation stages created complex interactions
- Difficult to predict overall saturation behavior
- Non-linear accumulation of harmonic content

### Inverse Scaling Method (Improved but flawed)
```c
// Inverse amplitude scaling approach (caused two-portion tails)
double inverse_scale = 1.0 / safe_amplitude;
double scaled_input = input * inverse_scale;
double saturated = tanh(scaled_input * DISTORTION_BASE);
double output = saturated * amplitude;
```

**Problems**:
- Tanh function has different slopes at different input levels
- Created sudden transitions in saturation behavior
- Two distinct phases visible in decay tails

### Final Linear Drive Method (Optimal Solution)
```c
// Simple linear drive interpolation (smooth, predictable)
double drive = MAX_SATURATION_DRIVE * (1.0 - amplitude) + MIN_SATURATION_DRIVE;
double saturated = tanh(input * drive);
double output = saturated / drive;
```

**Advantages**:
- Completely linear relationship between amplitude and saturation amount
- Single tanh stage with predictable behavior
- No discontinuities or sudden transitions
- Easy to understand and modify

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Unity Gain Passthrough
**Problem**: CV=1.0 with unity input not producing unity output
**Root Causes**: 
- Output compensation factor reducing levels
- Distortion applied even at maximum amplitude
**Solution**: 
- Set `OUTPUT_COMPENSATION = 1.0` for unity gain
- Ensure minimal drive (0.1) at full amplitude for near-clean passthrough
**Learning**: High-level signals must remain clean for authentic MODDEMIX behavior

### Challenge 2: Two-Portion Tail Behavior
**Problem**: Visible discontinuity in saturation during signal decay
**Root Cause**: Hard amplitude thresholds and tanh nonlinearity interactions
**Solution**: Linear drive interpolation eliminates all thresholds and discontinuities
**Learning**: Simple linear relationships often work better than complex mathematical models

### Challenge 3: Predictable User Control
**Problem**: Exponential VCA curve made CV control non-intuitive
**Solution**: Linear amplitude mapping (CV = amplitude percentage)
**Learning**: User experience should prioritize predictability over "analog authenticity"

### Challenge 4: Maintaining Output Levels
**Problem**: Saturation changes output level throughout amplitude range
**Solution**: Drive compensation (`output = saturated / drive`) maintains consistent levels
**Learning**: Level compensation is crucial for musical usability
